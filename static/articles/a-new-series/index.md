title: A new series! Reviews of obscure operating systems.

The first epic series which will span across many parts and include many operating systems. I hope that this will be my first actually running series, as I have never managed to make one stable yet.

The first review should come in a week or so, but do not be surprised if I don't (I'm not an active blogger).

(~~EDIT: The series should start about August or September as I will be engaged during June to August due to projects I have to complete. I will hopefully have time to document them on this blog~~ I have some doubts about finishing the project at all, but I’ll keep you informed of any updates...)

<hr>

I hope to only look at free software operating systems (or at least partially) however I will look at abandon-ware and some old closed source systems if I run out of ideas.

I am pretty confident in this series as I do have knowledge of some systems which are obscure (even if you don't think their uncommon, I aim to have the operating system clear less than 0.5% of the operating system market share - but no-one will actually publish the data since how will they get it when it's about the usage of OSes no-one uses on a day-to-day basis?).

A few rules for this series:

* No mobile OSes
* No GNU/Linux distributions (however, if they are interesting enough, I will make an independent review)
* Third-party software for the OS will not be mentioned unless it is interesting, necessary for the review, or something I want to test out.
* I test the operating system for current usability, I don't give exemptions to incomplete code or not enough drivers for either QEMU or the three computers I will test the systems on:
  * My computer (workstation), “elephant”: (it's bad, I know)
    * Processor		     : 2x AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 240 Processor
    * Memory		     : 9986MB (4266MB used)
    * OpenGL Renderer	 : Gallium 0.4 on AMD RS780 (DRM 2.43.0, LLVM 3.8.0)
  * An IBM Thinkpad R40e built in 2003
  * Some Acer Aspire laptop that is not mine, I'll only fall-back to it if all else fails.
* I will not write a review if nothing I try works, I will give it an honourable mention at the end of another review.

Anyway, I will use this layout for each of my reviews (might change throughout time however I will add it here if there's a change).

* A quick (or long) summary of what the OS is and what it wants to achieve
* My experience with the system on my physical machines
* Design of the graphical user interface and how usable it is (if there is one)
* Reviews of interesting programs included with the system
* Looking back at what the operating system wants to achieve and if it has been achieved
* A final thought and a mark out of this list (The operating system should be able to):
  * Display a 32-bit colour interface with a suitable resolution
  * Multiple monitor support
  * Alternate keyboard layouts support (Dvorak)
  * Playback of common video, music and image files
  * Word processing or some writing program
  * Compilation of code (most likely C however, other languages will do)
  * Browse the internet (third-party software may be required)
  * Some interesting or niche feature that makes the operating system stand out
* A conclusion
	
Now when I say operating system some of you may shout at me “OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE NOT GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES!!!!” and you are correct. In practise, you never interact with the operating systems, programs and libraries do, and you interact with the programs. However, I'll look how usable the programs are, which use the operating system. I will not look into technical details about the system or look at any underlying code (unless I already have previous knowledge).

I hope you enjoy this new series.
