# argarak.me
New website under different back-end.

## Details

This website will be hosted on the [argarak.me](http://argarak.me/) domain under [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/82675aee4c5d) with a Debian system running [nginx](http://nginx.org/).

The overall infrastructure is still under consideration however currently Iâ€™m looking at running this website with:

* Python back-end with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

* Custom comments and microblogging storage system.

* Switching frameworks from [angular.js v1.-](https://angularjs.org/) to [vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) to [vue-material](https://github.com/vuematerial/vue-material). This will help me create a cleaner and more maintainable structure to my code and also for longer-term reasons, since angular v1.- will become deprecated at some point and I don't want to use angular v2 due to poor documentation, poor ECMAScript 5 support, Typescript and confusing structure.

* No longer using [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) because the website is no longer statically generated.

* Deploying a WSGI-based server such as [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org) alongside nginx on a Debian server.

## Running in development mode

To start a debug flask server, use the `nexus` script like so:

`./nexus -d run`

## What's going to happen to `argarak.github.io`?

The original source code for that website will still be here for archival purposes but `argarak.github.io` will redirect to `argarak.me`. All the old blog posts will be available on the new website also.
